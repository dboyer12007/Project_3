# Top 500 Selling Albums Analysis

## Overview
The Top Selling Albums Analysis projects aims to create a comprehensive and interactive dataset of the best selling albums of all time. We aim to clean, transform and load (ETL workflow) the data into a relational data (PostgreSQL). The project will show the music trends in terms on genre, artist, release year.

## Objective
1. Extracting two datasets about top selling albums from Kaggle and MusicBrainz API. 
2. Cleaning and transforming data in order to merge both of the two data for analyzing.
3. Storing the transformed data in a PostgreSQL database with 5 tables for efficient and optimized querying.
4. Using tools such as JavaScript, Jupyuter Notebook or Python Flask API to visualize the dataset.
5. Analyzing the trends, and patterns of popular genres and artists.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and aggregation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive analysis environment.
- **Quick Database Diagrams**: For quickly creating relational database diagrams by typing or drawing schemas.

## Expected Outcomes
** By the end of this project, we aim to deliver:
- 
- 
- 
## Ethical Considerations
- Extracting datasets from reliable sources and making sure to cite them (Kaggle and MusicBrainz)
- Apllying integrity, transparency and ethical principles to data cleaning, transforming, loading.
