# Rolling Stones Top 500 Albums of All Time

## Overview
The Rolling Stones Top 500 Albums of All Time project aims to create a comprehensive and interactive dataset of the greatest albums of all time ranked by Rolling Stones Magazine. We aim to extract, transform, and load (ETL workflow) the data into relational data (PostgreSQL). The project will show the music trends in terms of genre, artist, and release year.

## Objective
1. Extracting two datasets about top-selling albums from Kaggle and MusicBrainz API. 
2. Cleaning and transforming data in order to merge both of the two data for analysis.
3. Storing the transformed data in a PostgreSQL database with 5 tables for efficient and optimized querying.
4. Using tools such as JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, or Python Flask API to visualize the dataset.
5. Analyzing the trends, and patterns of popular genres and artists.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and aggregation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive analysis environment.
- **Quick Database Diagrams**: For quickly creating relational database diagrams by typing or drawing schemas.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes from this objective are:
- Dataset Extraction: Successful retrieval of two datasets—one from Kaggle and the other from the MusicBrainz API—containing information about top-selling albums.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preparation of clean, consistent, and structured data by handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting inconsistencies to enable seamless merging of 
  the two datasets for analysis.
- Database Storage: Storing the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database with five well-designed tables optimized for efficient querying, normalization, and relational integrity.
- Data Visualization: Developing interactive and static visualizations using tools like JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, or Python Flask API to display insights from the dataset.

## Ethical Considerations
- Extracting datasets from reliable sources and making sure to cite them (Kaggle and MusicBrainz)
- Applying integrity, transparency, and ethical principles to data cleaning, transforming, and loading.
